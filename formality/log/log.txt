Note: No guide_hier_map commands were found in the SVF. It is
      important to enable guide_hier_map generation in
      Design Compiler to avoid SVF rejections that can cause
      aborted/failing points or long run times during verification.
      In Design Compiler the recommended methodology uses variable
      hdlin_enable_hier_map and command set_verification_top.

***************************** Synopsys Auto Setup Summary ******************************

!!! Synopsys Auto Setup Mode was enabled. !!!
!!! Verification results are valid assuming the following setup constraints: !!!

### RTL Interpretation Setup
   set hdlin_ignore_parallel_case false
   set hdlin_ignore_full_case false
   set hdlin_error_on_mismatch_message false
   set hdlin_ignore_embedded_configuration true

### Undriven Signal Handling Setup
   set verification_set_undriven_signals synthesis

### Test Logic Setup
   set verification_verify_directly_undriven_output false
   For details see report_dont_verify_points and report_constants

For further details on Synopsys Auto Setup Mode: Type man synopsys_auto_setup
****************************************************************************************


********************************* Verification Results *********************************
Verification SUCCEEDED
   ATTENTION: synopsys_auto_setup mode was enabled.
              See Synopsys Auto Setup Summary for details.
   ATTENTION: RTL interpretation messages were produced during link
              of reference design.
              Verification results may disagree with a logic simulator.
